<p>
    Amidst the fog and waves, a mystery<br>
On Shutter Island, the truth is history<br>
Two marshals, a missing woman to find<br>
But dark secrets are lurking behind<br>

The hospital's walls hold secrets untold<br>
As Teddy's mind begins to unfold<br>
Visions and nightmares cloud his way<br>
And the island's horrors come out to play<br>
</p>
<p>
    A storm is brewing, the island's alive<br>
    As Teddy's past begins to arrive<br>
    Reality blurs, illusions prevail<br>
    And the truth becomes a twisted tale<br>
</p>

<p>
    In the end, Teddy faces his fears<br>
    The mind games, the trauma, the tears<br>
    But the price of truth is steep indeed<br>
    On Shutter Island, there's no reprieve.<br>
