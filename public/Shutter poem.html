    <p>
        Amidst the fog and waves, a mystery<br>
    On Shutter Island, the truth is history<br>
    Two marshals, a missing woman to find<br>
    But dark secrets are lurking behind<br>
    
    The hospital's walls hold secrets untold<br>
    As Teddy's mind begins to unfold<br>
    Visions and nightmares cloud his way<br>
    And the island's horrors come out to play<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A storm is brewing, the island's alive<br>
        As Teddy's past begins to arrive<br>
        Reality blurs, illusions prevail<br>
        And the truth becomes a twisted tale<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the end, Teddy faces his fears<br>
        The mind games, the trauma, the tears<br>
        But the price of truth is steep indeed<br>
        On Shutter Island, there's no reprieve.<br>
