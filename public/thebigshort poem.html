	<p>In the world of finance, a few could see<br>
	The bubble building, the catastrophe<br>
	Hedge funds and bankers, blinded by greed<br>
	While a few outsiders dared to take the lead</p>

	<p>A bet against the market, a risky play<br>
	But these renegades were willing to sway<br>
	The system, the status quo, the norm<br>
	To bring down the banks and expose the storm</p>

<p>From New York to Florida, the hunt begins<br>
	For the signs, the signals, the smoking gun<br>
	And as the numbers pile up and mount<br>
	The truth is clear, the bubble's set to count
</p>
    <p>The market crashes, the world's in shock<br>
        But for some, it's the ultimate jackpot<br>
        The system crumbles, the banks go under<br>
        As the few who saw it all, ride the thunder
    </p>
    
    <p>In the end, a lesson to be learned<br>
        Of greed and folly, and the bridges burned<br>
        For those who dared to take a stand<br>
        The big short, a victory so grand.
