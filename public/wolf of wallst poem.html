<h1>The Wolf of Wall Street</h1>
<p>A tale of greed and excess, so bold,
Jordan Belfort was the man, or so he was told,
His rise was meteoric, his riches untold,
But his fall was inevitable, his downfall foretold.</p>

<p>He built an empire on lies and deceit,
With his cunning wit, he could sell any feat,
His stocks soared high, his wealth grew sweet,
But his vices and excess, he couldn't beat.</p>

<p>The drugs, the sex, the endless pleasure,
Brought him down to the depths, with no measure,
He lost it all, his empire, his treasure,
And ended up behind bars, without any leisure.</p>

<p>The Wolf of Wall Street, a cautionary tale,
Of how greed and excess, could make you pale,
A story of power, and how it could fail,
A reminder that morality, should always prevail.</p>
